## About

It's only PoC (Proove-of-Concept). No consumer details. Devs only.

This is my *veeery quuuick* UWP "port" of [The Dodo Archipelago](https://rouli.itch.io/the-dodo-archipelago) exploration game. At now draft / early bird / proto. To be continued... So, at now it only "walker" via empty world with empty inventary! :))))

Main goal: do more exploration of special game "frameworks" such FMOD and port it to Windows 10 Mobile....
